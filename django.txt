1)Starting a project in Django:
create a directory just for that project.
Run the command
"django-admin.py startproject mysite"
mysite can be any name you want to give your project.

2)Start the django server:
type this command inside the project's directory which contains manage.py.

"python manage.py runserver".

3)To start the python interpretor for your current django project go to the directory which contains the 'manage.py' file of your project.And enter the command
"python manage.py shell"

Interpretor will run.

4)Template: A django Template is a class contained inside django.templates .Here is an example:
s='My name is {{myself}}'
Here myself is a variable that can be used inside a template.It should be placed between {{ and }} .To create a Template object :
t=Template(s)
t can be rendered but requires a Context object as a parameter.

5)Context: A django Context is a class contained inside django.templates .this type of object is created by calling Context() contructor with a dcitionary containing the name of the variable used in a template(myself here) as a key and the value is the value of that variable.
c=Context({'myself':'Atul Tripathi'})
t.render(c)
The output will be : 'My name is Atul Tripathi'

6)Tags:There are various types of tags

s="""{% if this_variable %}
Do Something 
{%endif%}
"""

will Do Something if this_variable is not false or 0 or None.Use of paranthesis not allowed inside .USe nested if tags instead.you can also use {%else%} between if and endif.
